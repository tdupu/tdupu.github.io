<h3>Traveling to Burlington</h3>

<p>Burlington has an international airport (BTV). The cab fare from the airport to downtown (near the University) is approximately $20.</p> 

<p>By private car, Burlington is three and a half hours away from Boston and less than two hours away from Montreal (please allow more time to clear customs; it can take anywhere betweeen 20 minutes to over an hour).</p>

<p>By bus, Burlington is about four hours away from Boston (served by <a href="http://us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> and <a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a>) and three hours away from Montreal (served by <a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a>).</p>

<p>One can also ride the train to Essex Junction, which is 15 minutes away from UVM (the station is served by <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home">Amtrak</a>) or by <a href="http://ferries.com/">ferry</a> across Lake Champlain from the state of New York.

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>We will have talks from approximately 9am to 5pm on Saturday September 10, and from 9am to 1pm on Sunday September 11.</p>
<p>The talks will be held in Votey 105. Contrary to what was noted before, there is free parking right by the building where the talks will be held. Here is a <a href="./parkingmap.pdf">parking map</a>.</p>


<h3>Hotel</h3>

<p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the Hilton Burlington, at the cost of $209 plus tax (~$232) per night, in single or double occupancy. To make a reservation, please call 1-800-445-8667 and mention the special rate code <b>AGC</b> (for Anabelian Geometry Conference). Alternatively, you can reserve a room online on <a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/B/BTTVTHF-AGC-20160909/index.jhtml">our dedicated Hilton reservation site</a>. All rooms must be booked by August 17.</p>

<p>Graduate students who would like help finding someone to share a room with can contact <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~cvincen1/">Christelle Vincent</a>.</p>

<p>There are some more economical options outside of the downtown Burlington area. Most likely they would require using a car to travel to campus. There is easy parking on campus near our venue; here is a <a href="./parkingmap.pdf">parking map</a>.</p>
