For 100 coin flips:

--62% of flips have streaks of length >=6 of both THTHTH or TTTTTT
--3% are missing both
--17% have one pattern and not the other
--20% only have streaks <= 5 of TTTTT
--On average there are 6 streaks of size 2 of each type on average.
--One can pick any string of length 6 and test for that so testing against THTHTH, TTTTTT, THHTTT will all give the same result.
