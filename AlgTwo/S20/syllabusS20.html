The main point of this                course is to get to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory                which is about the correspondence between subgroups and field                extensions (we will learn what this means). Here is what we are                going to cover in Dummit and Foote: Chapter 8: all sections;                Chapter 9: Sections 1 to 5; Chapter 10: Sections 1 to 3; Chapter                11: Sections 1 to 2; Chapter 13: all sections; Chapter 14:                Sections 1 to 7; Chapter 12: all sections</p>              <p> Your grade in this course will be determined on the basis of                homework, two mid-term exams (approximately Friday, March 6 and                Wednesday, April 22nd), and a final exam (takehome due May 4th),                and will be the maximum of the following two grades: </p>              <blockquote> A: 20% for the homework (worst two scores removed)                and for each of the two mid-term exams, and 40% for the final                exam.                <p> B: 100% final exam (provided the grade determined in A is at                  least a "C") </p>              </blockquote>              <p> Homework will be due at the beginning of class on the assigned                due date and no late homework will be accepted (note that the                two worst homework scores are removed from the grading precisely                to allow for occasions where submitting homework on time may not                be possible). Guidelines for the preparation of homework can be                found here: </p>              <p> <a href="homework_guidelines.html">Guidelines for Homework                  Assignments </a> </p>              <p> Exams may be rescheduled only for compelling, legitimate, and                documented reasons. In general, if it is necessary to miss an                exam your grade will be determined on the basis of your other                work. </p>              <p> Collaboration on homework is both allowed and encouraged -                discussing solutions to mathematics problems is one of the best                ways to learn mathematics. Any work submitted must be your own                and honest - for example, you must write up your own solutions                and be prepared to publicly defend in class any solution you                submit. Any joint work should be acknowledged explicitly.                Solutions simply copied from some other source without                attribution are intellectually dishonest and can be the grounds                for dismissal. </p>              <hr>              <p> </p>            </li>          </font>          <li><font color="#000000"><b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b> Students are expected              to observe appropriate codes of conduct.
