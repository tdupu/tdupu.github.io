How are we going to use in class time: 
1) divide into random groups of 5 and work on a problem or answer questions from the question box.
2) answer questions to the class. 
3) special puzzles.
4) youtube live streams (you can chat on Zulip).
5) YouTube premieres 

Grading:
-The entire class is going to be based on homework and participation
-top 3 of n w/scoring procedure
-every one you submit you need to review two (I will review any mismatches and handle disputes)

80 homework
20 participation

10% On time review percentage. 
10% Meeting percentage. 

-participation:

Features:

-If you want, you can submit as a group (with one person as a managing editor) but this means your grade is going to be out of one more problem.
