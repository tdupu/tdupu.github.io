For (1c), a shouldn't assumes what it wants to prove unless it does so for the sake of contradiction. is just a bunch of formulas. 
In (6c), it says that the set is a group then not a group. 
In (6e), the proof doesn't prove that (1/2) ZZ is a group. It should be refering to it as a set.


Score 10
Small mistake on division associativity. 


Score: 6
Comments: no proofs, one proof by example


Score 7	
In (1c) you are working with the wrong operation.
In (6) you aren't checking closure.


Score 10	
We say "…is closed under addition" not "…is close under addition".


Assignment 1.1:31
Score 8	
Proof doesn't draw the conclusion it should. 


Score 5	
The proof repeats parts of what is supposed to be stated but makes no reference to t(G) or its complement.


Score 7	
The language is really imprecise. For example the word "pair" is not properly defined in the way that it is used.
