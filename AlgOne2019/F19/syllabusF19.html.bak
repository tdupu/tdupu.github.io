              <p> This course will cover the material in Chapters 1-5 (the basic
                theory of groups, subgroups, and quotient groups), portions of
                Chapter 6 (some topics in greater depth dealing with finite
                groups, including solvable and nilpotent groups), and Chapter 7
                (the basic theory of rings, ideals, and quotient rings). This
                course forms the basis for the continued study of the basic
                algebraic structures (groups, rings, and fields) in the sequel:
                Math 252. </p>
              <p> Your grade in this course will be determined on the basis of
                homework, two mid-term exams (approximately Wednesday, October 2
                and Wednesday, November 19), and a final exam (Friday, December
                13,  10:30a.m. -- 1:15 p.m., in L111 Lafayette), and will be the maximum of
                the following two grades: </p>
              <blockquote> A: 20% for the homework (worst two scores removed)
                and for each of the two mid-term exams, and 40% for the final
                exam.
                <p> B: 100% final exam (provided the grade determined in A is at
                  least a "C") </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Homework will be due at the beginning of class on the assigned
                due date and no late homework will be accepted (note that the
                two worst homework scores are removed from the grading precisely
                to allow for occasions where submitting homework on time may not
                be possible). Guidelines for the preparation of homework can be
                found here: </p>
              <p> <a href="homework_guidelines.html">Guidelines for Homework
                  Assignments </a> </p>
              <p> Exams may be rescheduled only for compelling, legitimate, and
                documented reasons. In general, if it is necessary to miss an
                exam your grade will be determined on the basis of your other
                work. </p>
              <p> Collaboration on homework is both allowed and encouraged -
                discussing solutions to mathematics problems is one of the best
                ways to learn mathematics. Any work submitted must be your own
                and honest - for example, you must write up your own solutions
                and be prepared to publicly defend in class any solution you
                submit. Any joint work should be acknowledged explicitly.
                Solutions simply copied from some other source without
                attribution are intellectually dishonest and can be the grounds
                for dismissal. </p>

              <p> Students have the right to practice the religion of their
                choice. Each semester students should submit in writing to their
                instructors by the end of the second full week of classes their
                documented religious holiday schedule for the semester. Faculty
                must permit students who miss work for the purpose of religious
                observance to make up this work. </p>
              <p> Students requiring special accommodations must make
                arrangements within the first two weeks of class. </p>
