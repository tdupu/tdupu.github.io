        <h2>Homework Assignment Guidelines </h2>
        <br>
        <hr> <font color="#000000"> The following guidelines should be followed
          when turning in homework assignments to be graded:
          <p> </p>
          <li> Homework is due at or before the beginning of class on the
            assigned due date. Late homework will not be accepted. It is your
            responsibility to ensure that homework assignments are received.
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li> You should take pride in your work. In particular, assignments
            should be neat and legible. If you use pencil, be sure what you
            write can be read easily. Use scratch paper for preliminary
            computations and submit only polished work. Be sure your name is on
            your submitted work. If you collaborate with someone (or use some
            other source) on the assignment, you must note that explicitly.
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li> Staple your assignment sheets together in the upper left hand
            corner (this is to ease the grading - I grade each problem for
            everyone in the class to ensure uniformity before moving to the next
            problem to grade).
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li> Number your submitted exercises as they are numbered on the
            assignment page (i.e., 1,2,3,...). If you want to record which text
            exercise the problem is, use something like "3. (Section 1.2,
            exercise 8)". Again, this is so that I can grade everyone's "problem
            3" without having to search each assignment extensively for the
            correct problem. Please submit only problems identified for
            submission - although you should, of course, do all the assigned
            problems, please only turn in the numbered problems identified on
            the homework assignment (again so that I can quickly find everyone's
            "problem 3").
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li> Indicate your answers clearly and neatly. You need not box in
            answers (although occasionally this helps), but you do need to make
            clear what your final answer is when appropriate.
            <p> </p>
          </li>
        </font>
        <li><font color="#000000"> Use good mathematical style when writing
            proofs (more will be said about this in class). In particular, avoid
            tedious run-on sentences. Concision and elegance count.
