Title: 
Overview of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials<br>

Abstract:
In 1979, Kazhdan and Lusztig constructed certain representations of
the Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter group W in order to
elucidate representation-theoretic questions concerning W itself. To
do this, they introduced a class of polynomials now known as the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. These polynomials were immediately seen
to have important interpretations in the context of Lie theory and
Schubert varieties. In this talk I'll give an overview of
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials while highlighting (as time and my
knowledge allow) general connections in geometry and representation
theory.
