    <h1><a href="index.html">Taylor Dupuy</a>'s letter of recommendation
      information</h1>
    <div> (This page is stolen from David Zureick-Brown who appears to have
      stolen it from Kiran Kedlaya (?) who has stole it from Ravi Vakil.)</div>
    <div>Below is my checklist of things I ask for when I write a letter. (Some
      of these you may have already done.) </div>
    <ul>
      <li> Please try to let me know at least a <b>month in advance</b>. (I
        will still try to accomodate shorter deadlines, but the letter is likely
        to be better if I have more time.) </li>
      <li> A list of links to the <b>instructions/prompt</b> for the letter
        writer, with deadlines. </li>
      <li> Instructions on <b>how to submit</b> (e.g., email to XXX, "you will
        receive an email", or send me a link, etc). </li>
      <li>Please also find out things like whether I need to mail a physical
        letter vs. upload to a web site, if my letter has a different deadline
        than the rest of your application, and any other special instructions. </li>
      <li> I have a <b>strong preference</b> for PDF or plain text documents. A
        spreadsheet is also ok. </li>
      <li> Please <b> include your name</b> in the filename of any documents
        you send me. </li>
      <li> Who are your <b>other letter writers?</b> Include a sentence of
        context too (e.g., advised my honors thesis). </li>
      <li> Once you have <b>drafts</b> of anything you're submitting please
        send them to me. The basic principle is that I can't write about
        something I don't know about. </li>
      <li> I'd prefer you send an <b>unofficial copy of your transcript</b> too
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    I leave it up to the applicant to make sure that I don't miss the deadline
    (something which has never happened so don't worry). I ask that you send me
    frequent email (every week or more as the deadlines grow closer) to remind
    me. I won't forget but this keeps it at the top of my to-do list. At some
    point I will then send you an email back saying that I have
    mailed/uploaded/etc the letter. If you do not receive an email from me
    verifying that I submitted a letter, then I very likely have not; I leave
    you responsible for keeping track of which letters I need to submit. <br>
    <br>
    Finally, on the application page, please use the following for my personal
    information.
